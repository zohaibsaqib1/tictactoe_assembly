# tictactoe_assembly
A human vs. computer tic tac toe game written in assembly. 

How to play tic tac toe using our program!

1)	Assemble and run the code in MARS or other MIPS simulators.

2)	Choose which character you want to play with. Select “1” to play as “X” and “0” to play as “O”. The computer will be the unselected character.

3)	Select which spot you want your character to take up. The accepted values are from 1-9, and empty spots are displayed as numbers. If the selection is invalid, the game will prompt you to make another selection until you give an acceptable response.

4)	Keep going back and forth until either you win, the computer wins, or there’s a tie between you and the computer.

5)	To play again, the code must be reset, reassembled, and rerun. Follow steps 2-4 again once the game runs again.
